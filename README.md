# Pale

A website for my band "pale".

This is a hub for all things going on with pale and is to be used as a major part of our branding. Use of monochrome and monospace to portay the themes that are in our music on our website

Pale itself is still within its forming peorid of time, we have written 4, 4 track eps which form one album, or cycle, and are about to head into the studio to record. We are building up a portfolio of all forms of media (artwork, videos, photoshoots, music), and the website will evolve with our progress.
 
## UX

This website is the key for all infomation regarding pale and making sure users of all types can access our content and contact us eaisly, while still experincing something very on brand for pale. 

The users can be broken down into 3 major groups, Potential fans, Loyal fans and promoters. 

User Stories:

User 1
Potential fan Saw us at a live show and wanted to check out music to share on his social media. Found the website through a social media link. Short attention span so the first image would need to be striking. Watches half the video, wants to leave with some content to remember us by.

User 2
Promoter. Wants to find band information and contact details. Needs quick access to contact information

User 3
Loyal Fan. Looking for to play music so he can engage with us. Likely to spend longer than any other user on the website.

To faciatate all different user types the website needs to have a clear easy to use navbar, strong imagery and access to music/video. 

In design terms, pale portrays sorrow in its music and how we present ourselves, and this is a key elemnt in the design process. We have choosen to have no logo, and use a strong monospaced font throughout the page, using blacks and greys to create space around the artowrk.

Inside the wireframe folder there is a seperate wireframe for each page, including the basic navbar and social media links on every page.

## Features

### Existing Features

Navbar - Fixed top navbav so the user has access to all pages of the website. Upon collapse this falls into a simple dropdown menu.

Video Lander - Autoplaying muted video upon landing on index page. This is to draw the eye yet be non intrustive via being muted.

Music Player - Within the Media page there are playable songs with the option to download. No autoplay to let the user define their own experience 

Footer - At the bottom of every page so users can direct to social media with ease

Gigs - Upcoming gigs including location, time and a link to purchase tickets

### Features Left to Implement

Artwork - Within the media page a dedicated artwork section (Each song in cycle 1 has its own piece of artwork)

Mailing List

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
